## What are Integrations?

An **Integration** in the Complyance platform is a reusable template that defines how your business data maps to tax compliance requirements for specific countries and document types. Think of it as a blueprint that learns your data structure once and then applies that knowledge to process multiple documents consistently.

<Info>
Integrations are the core building blocks that enable automated tax compliance. Once configured, they can process thousands of documents with the same mapping rules.
</Info>

## How Integrations Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Analysis">
    When you create an integration, our AI analyzes your data structure to understand field relationships and data patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Field Mapping">
    The system automatically maps your fields to compliance requirements (37 GETS fields + country-specific fields)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Template Creation">
    A reusable template is created that can process future documents with the same structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Processing">
    Use the integration to convert your business data into compliant documents for tax authorities
  </Step>
</Steps>

</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

### Design Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Country">
    **When to use**: Operating in one country with consistent requirements
    
    ```javascript
    // Create country-specific integration
    const integration = await createIntegration({
      country: 'SA',
      documentType: 'tax_invoice',
      template: 'saudi-zatca-standard'
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multi-Country">
    **When to use**: Global operations with different compliance needs
    
    ```javascript
    // Create multi-country integration
    const integration = await createIntegration({
      countries: ['SA', 'MY'],
      documentTypes: ['tax_invoice', 'credit_note'],
      template: 'global-compliance'
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Document-Specific">
    **When to use**: Different document types require different mappings
    
    ```javascript
    // Create document-type specific integrations
    const invoiceIntegration = await createIntegration({
      country: 'SA',
      documentType: 'tax_invoice'
    });
    
    const creditNoteIntegration = await createIntegration({
      country: 'SA', 
      documentType: 'credit_note'
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Performance Optimization

- **Template Reuse**: Create templates for common document structures
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar documents for efficient processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently used mappings and validations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust retry logic for network failures

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Field Mapping Issues">
    **Problem**: AI cannot map certain fields automatically
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure field names are descriptive and consistent
    - Provide sample data with all required fields populated
    - Use manual mapping for complex or custom fields
    - Check data format compatibility (dates, numbers, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validation Failures">
    **Problem**: Integration validation fails during testing
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify all mandatory fields are mapped (42 for Saudi Arabia)
    - Check data format compliance (VAT numbers, dates, amounts)
    - Review country-specific requirements
    - Test with various document samples
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Issues">
    **Problem**: Slow processing or timeouts
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Optimize payload size (recommended < 10MB)
    - Use batch processing for multiple documents
    - Implement proper error handling and retries
    - Consider caching for frequently used templates
